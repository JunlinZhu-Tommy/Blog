# Selectors

## Basic Selectors

## Universal Selector
```css
*.
```

## Type Selector
```css
input
```

## Class Selector
```css
.classname
```

## ID Selector
```css
#idname
```

## Attribute Selector
```css
[attr] [attr=value] [attr~=value] [attr|=value] [attr^=value] [attr$=value] [attr*=value]
```

## Grouping Selectors

### Selector List  (Select all matching nodes).
```css
A, B 
```

## Combinators

### Descendent
```css
A B
```

### Child 
```css
A > B
```

### Child sibling combinator (This means that the second element follows the first (though not necessarily immediately), and both share the same parent.)
```css
A ~ B
```

### Adjacent sibling (The + combinator selects adjacent siblings. This means that the second element directly follows the first, and both share the same parent.)
```css
A + B
```

## Pseudo

### Pseudo classes (is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).)
```css
a:visited
```

### Pseudo elements (s a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).)
```css
::first-line
```
