## Question
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]

## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
    if (!numbers || numbers.length === 0) {
        return numbers;
    }

    let results = [];
    let left = 0;
    let right = numbers.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

        if (sum < target) {
            left++;   
        } else if (sum > target) {
            right--;
        } else {
            // Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
            results = [++left, ++right];
            
            return results
        }
    }
    
    return results;
};
```
