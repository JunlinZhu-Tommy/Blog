## Question
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {ListNode}
 * @solution
 * Two dummy nodes, 
 * dummyOne connect node with val less than target x.
 * dummyTwo connect node with val not less than target x.
 * 
 * Traverse linked list from head and assign node on corresponding dummy node by comparing with x.
 */
var partition = function(head, x) {
    if (!head) {
        return head;
    }

    const dummyOne = new ListNode();
    const dummyTwo = new ListNode();
    let curt = head;
    let less = dummyOne;
    let greater = dummyTwo;

    while (curt) {
        if (curt.val < x) {
            less.next = curt;
            less = less.next;
        } else {
            greater.next = curt;
            greater = greater.next;
        }

        curt = curt.next;
    }

    greater.next = null;
    less.next = dummyTwo.next;

    return dummyOne.next;
};
