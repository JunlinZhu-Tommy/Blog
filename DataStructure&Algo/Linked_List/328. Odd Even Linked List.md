## Question
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 * @solution
 * 1. Typical two pointers question.
 * 2. One pointer with odd indexed node, and another one with even indexed node.
 * 3. Traverse though the linked list based on even indexed node.
 * 4. assign to odd pointer with odd indexed node and vice versa.
 * 5. Connect odd pointer with even pointer, and return first one.
