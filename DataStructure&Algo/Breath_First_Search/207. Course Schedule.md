## Question
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} numCourses
 * @param {number[][]} prerequisites
 * @return {boolean}
 * @solution
 * [0, 1] => 1 is the prerequisite of 0
 * 1. Build Graph as Map (prereq, [...nextCourses]).
 * 2. Compute in-degree of each node.
 * 3. Do Bfs from each node with 0 in-degree and count number of reached courses.
 * 4. Return true if count reached courses equals total number of courses.
