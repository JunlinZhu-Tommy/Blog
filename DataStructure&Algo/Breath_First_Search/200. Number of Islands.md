## Question
Given an m x n 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */

const X_DIRECTIONS = [1, 0, 0, -1]
const Y_DIRECTIONS = [0, 1, -1, 0]

var numIslands = function(grid) {
    if (
        !Array.isArray(grid) || 
        grid.length === 0 ||
        grid[0].length === 0
    ) {
        return 0
    }

    let ans = 0

    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === '1') {
                bfs(grid, i, j)
                ans++
            }
        }
    }

    return ans
};

function bfs(grid, x, y) {
    const queue = [{
        x, y
    }]

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const coordinate = queue.shift()

        for (let i = 0; i < X_DIRECTIONS.length; i++) {
            const nextX = coordinate?.x + X_DIRECTIONS[i]
            const nextY = coordinate?.y + Y_DIRECTIONS[i]

            if (inBound(grid, nextX, nextY) && grid[nextX][nextY] === '1') {
                grid[nextX][nextY] = '0'
                queue.push({
                    x: nextX,
                    y: nextY
                })
            }
        }
    }   
}

function inBound(grid, x, y) {
    return x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < grid.length && y < grid[0].length
}
