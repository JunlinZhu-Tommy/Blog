## Question
You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, their importance value and their direct subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their subordinates.

Example 1:

Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for Employee.
 * function Employee(id, importance, subordinates) {
 *     this.id = id;
 *     this.importance = importance;
 *     this.subordinates = subordinates;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {Employee[]} employees
 * @param {number} id
 * @return {number}
 */
var GetImportance = function(employees, id) {
    if (!employees || employees.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    } 

    const queue = []
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add(id);
    queue.push(id);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const curId = queue.shift();
        
        for (const ep of employees) {
            if (ep.id === curId) {
                for (const sub of ep.subordinates) {
                    queue.push(sub);
                    visited.add(sub);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let sum = 0;

    for (const ep of employees) {
        for (const epId of visited) {
            if (epId === ep.id) {
                sum += ep.importance;
            }
        }
    }

    return sum;
